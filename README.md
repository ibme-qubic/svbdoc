Documentation for SVB
=====================

This module contains documentation for the Stochastic Variational Bayes implementation
so it can be hosted on readthedocs.

For now the code is kept internally. Hopefully it can all be externalised at some
point.

If you are interested in the code please contact michael.chappell@eng.ox.ac.uk
